            <h2>Key Features</h2>
            <p>Best Before allows you to keep track of the best before and use by dates on the food you buy. You scan the barcode of your item to get the information about it. Then you can set the best before date into the calendar where it automatically sets reminders until when it is about to go past its best before or use by date. <br><br>

            Best Before categorizes your food so it is easy to find what you need. You can search for a past food item and simply update the best before or use by date to get added into calendar again. <br><br>

            With food that has gone past its best before date it gets sorted into the “Past Date” where it shows you the food that has gone past its date and how much longer it recommends you should keep it until you need to throw it away.
