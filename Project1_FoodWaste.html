            <h2>How it works</h2>
            <p>Best Before scans the best before date of your food sets up reminders in its database to tell you when something is still before its date or has passed its date. Depending on how long it has before the date, the app will set a different amount of reminders. For example if a products best before date is in a week. The app will set up 3 reminders before the date and on the day it will let you know that the best before day is today. After it the best before date the product will get put into the After section of the app. The After section allows you to see what has passed its best before date and lets you decide to keep it or dispose of it.</p>
