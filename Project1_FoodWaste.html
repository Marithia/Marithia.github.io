            <h2>Key Features</h2>
            <p>Best Before allows you to keep track of the best before and use by dates on the food you buy. You scan the barcode of your item and it then set the best before date into the calander where it reminds what is about to go past its use by or best before date. <br><br>

You can search for a past food item you have brought and just update the best before or use by date. Best Before categories your food so it is easy to find what you need. <br><br>

With food that has gone past its best before date it gets sorted into the “Past Date” where it shows you all the food that has gone past its date and how much longer you have until you need to throw it away.
